Counting number of  so called average subset of {1, 2, 3, ..., n} where n is too large for brute-forcing

I experimented with locally-run AI solutions and publicly available ones like Gemini or Copilot in Skype.  Part of my findings are documented in the second commit. 
I also conducted numerous experiments with online-only models, but none were particularly impressive. Claude 3 Opus was the best so far https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Using-dynamic-programing-lYF8IDsbT0.yQ413J3GsMw , though the results were inconsistent. 
I was surprised by Google Gemini Advanced, tested on May 16, 2024.  (The conversation can be found here: https://g.co/gemini/share/5150339c75fd)
I have decided to share some of my earlier experiences using a paid subscription of perplexity.ai, hope you can open them

gpt4 turbo in the end was able to hack a code to be show perfect result based on my instruction - I do not prefer such hack

You can see in my gemini advanced conversation when I ask gemini to eliminate this dirty hack from gpt4 turbo, with my strong help it succeeded

I wonder when this post will be discovered and, subsequently, when AI will be proficient in handling this type of problem. For more details, please refer to the commit's description.
